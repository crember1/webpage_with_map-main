      <h3 style="color:white">Introduction</h3>
      <h5 style="color:white">Bike sharing, an up-and-coming transportation style in various cities and urban areas, gives passengers easy access to move around town. 
      In Charlotte, North Carolina, B-Cycle - a docked Bike Sharing MoD system - provides 343 bikes and 34 stations throughout the Queen City for easy transportation. 
      Charlotte B-cycle launched in 2012 with only 200 bikes and 20 stations, but through various sponsorships, grants, and support over the last eight years, the company has grown to its current size. 
      In addition to providing its services, Charlotte B-cycle also works to support the local community. 
      When you see one of their bikes whizzing around town, you'll  notice each bike sports a piece of art created by a local artist.
      <br> Below we have different map plots that display where our data is, where the docks are located, and accumulation trends that occur. </h5>

    <h2 style="color:white">Conclusion</h2>
    <h5 style="color:white">Our maps express a story. In Fig. 3, most of the bike stations are located inside interstate 77 and 485 in the inner city accumulating the most usage combined, while there are less stations outside the city. We believe people in the inner city use these bikes to commute to and from work.
      The stations south of Charlotte are in South End, a highly commercial area, which means people commute to and from entertainment and shopping.
      In addition, in Fig. 5, the number of bus stations compared to bike stations are exponentially larger showing a greater interest in buses versus bikes. As you can see in the Fig. 6, there is not that many bike lanes in the city; therefore, most bikes will either be on the sidewalk or a part of traffic creating potiential self risk.</h5>
  </div>
    <div class="container one-bottom" >
    <h5 style="color:white">Figure 4- The B-Cycle dock locations are located beside multiple building types, but the zoning data indicates that there are not many in the areas of center city with the most residential buildings. The multi-family and condo/townhome building types shown in purple do not have many bicycle docks within a few blocks,  while government and commercial buildings have the highest number of docks adjacent to them. B-Cycle seem to have located docks at high-density workplaces and commercial buildings to allow for commuters to use the bikes as a last-mile solution. Charlotte has several dockless bike-sharing systems in place, so these are not the only available bikes to commuters.</h5>
    
    <h5 style="color:white">Figure 5- Figure 5 shows the relationship between CATS bus stops and B-Cycle docks in center city. Almost all of the docks have bus stops within a block of them, which allows commuters to easily access the bike sharing service for shorter trips when they arrive in Uptown via bus. Customers pay an access fee for 24 hours and can check out bikes for up to 30 minutes without paying added fees. This model works for commuters who are making multiple short trips that do not require the use of the bus system.</h5>
   
    <h5 style="color:white">Figure 6- This map shows the relationship between current bike lane locations and B-Cycle station locations in Charlotte. Many of the roads in Charlotte do not have bike lanes, so most of the bike traffic will share the roads or sidewalks. As the use of MoD systems increases, car traffic in the city center should decrease, allowing for safer travel via bike, but the lack of dedicated lanes could deter people from using bicycles due to safety concerns.</h5>

  <div class="container one-bottom" >
    <h2 style="color:white">Discussion</h2>
    <h4 style="color:white">Based off all given data, these are some suggestions we have to improve the relationships between stations and other attributes in Charlotte.</h4>
    <h5 style="color:white">1. Expand B-Cycle station locations to more residential areas both within the city and outside of the city to give local commuters more mobility options.</h5>  
    <h5 style="color:white">2. Coordinate future expansion of CATS bus stop locations to all B-Cycle station locations, giving those using the CATS bus system more mobility options going to and from the bus stops.</h5> 
    <h5 style="color:white">3. Expand bike lane infrastructure within the city to reach more B-Cycle station locations.</h5> 
    <h5 style="color:white">4. Coordinate future expansion of B-Cycle station locations with stop locations of other mobility services including the LYNX BlueLine and future options like the LYNX SilverLine.</h5>
